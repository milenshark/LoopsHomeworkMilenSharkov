//        Problem 10. Word or Number 2
//        You are given an integer number n and then n new lines of text: numbers or words (see Problem 6).
//        This time when we have a word we concatenate it with the previous words with a dash - between them.
//        If we have a number we add it to all previous numbers.
//
//        The input starts by the number n (alone in a line) followed by n lines, each holding a text without a space.
//        Again all words contain no digits.
//        The output is like in the examples below.
//        On the first line there are all words concatenated with - between them or no words if there were no words in the input.
//        On the second line is the sum of all the numbers or 0 if there were no numbers.
